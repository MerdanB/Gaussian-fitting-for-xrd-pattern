# Gaussian-fitting-for-xrd-pattern

This R code performs Gaussian fitting for multi peaks data. It requires for manually editing starting peak positions returned by small peak finder function and providing inital starting same deviation (at least for now, may be improved by finding FWHM for each peak) value for all peaks.
